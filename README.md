# Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Files using LLM
<br>

In this project, you will create a chatbot for your own pdf file using Flask, a popular web framework, and the Langchain, another popular framework for working wtih Large Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot you develop will not just interact with users via text but also comprehend and answer questions related to the content of a specific document.

# Tech
Chatbots:
Chatbots are software applications designed to engage in human-like conversation. They can respond to text inputs from users and are widely used in various domains, including customer service, eCommerce, and education. In this project, you will build a chatbot capable of not only engaging users in a general conversation but also answering queries based on a particular document.

LangChain:
LangChain is a versatile tool for building AI-driven language applications. It provides various functionalities such as text retrieval, summarization, translation, and many more, by leveraging pretrained language models. In this project, you will be integrating LangChain into your chatbot, empowering it to understand and respond to diverse user inputs effectively.

Flask:
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, known for its simplicity and speed. A web framework is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including the creation of web servers, and management of HTTP requests and responses.

You will use Flask to create the server side or backend of your chatbot. This involves handling incoming messages from users, processing these messages, and sending appropriate responses back to the user.

Routes in Flask:
Routes are an essential part of web development. When your application receives a request from a client (typically a web browser), it needs to know how to handle that request. This is where routing comes in.

In Flask, routes are created using the @app.route decorator to bind a function to a URL route. When a user visits that URL, the associated function is executed. In your chatbot project, you will use routes to handle the POST requests carrying user messages and to process document data.

HTML - CSS - JavaScript:
You are provided with a ready-to-use chatbot front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures web content, CSS styles it and JavaScript adds interactivity. These technologies create a visually appealing and interactive chatbot interface.
